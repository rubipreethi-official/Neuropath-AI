# Algorithm Update - Career Interest Analysis

## Problem
The previous implementation used a TensorFlow.js Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with synthetic training data. This approach had several issues:
- Random noise in synthetic data caused unpredictable results
- Small dataset (only 5 samples per category) led to poor model performance
- Training was unreliable and gave incorrect predictions
- Example: User giving 5/5 for programming but getting "Environmental Science" as result

## Solution
Replaced the ANN with a **Cosine Similarity + Weighted Distance** algorithm that directly compares user responses to predefined feature mappings.

### New Algorithm Overview

#### 1. **Cosine Similarity**
Measures the angle between two vectors (user responses vs. category features):
- Range: -1 to 1 (higher is better)
- Captures pattern similarity regardless of magnitude
- Formula: `cos(θ) = (A · B) / (||A|| × ||B||)`

#### 2. **Weighted Euclidean Distance**
Calculates distance with emphasis on high-interest areas:
- Lower distance = better match
- Higher user scores get more weight in calculation
- Ensures strong preferences have more influence

#### 3. **Ranking System**
- Primary sort: Cosine similarity (descending)
- Secondary sort: Weighted distance (ascending)
- Returns top match with confidence score
- Also shows alternative matches

### Benefits

✅ **Accurate**: Direct comparison with no training needed
✅ **Deterministic**: Same input always gives same output
✅ **Fast**: No model training required
✅ **Transparent**: Easy to understand and debug
✅ **Reliable**: No random noise affecting results

### Example
If a user responds:
- Programming: 5
- Design: 2
- Math: 4
- Others: 1-2

The algorithm will:
1. Calculate similarity with all 42 categories
2. Find categories with high programming + math values
3. Return "AI / Data Science", "Web Development", or similar
4. Provide confidence score (e.g., 87.3% match)

### Code Changes
- Removed: TensorFlow.js imports and ANN model code
- Added: `cosineSimilarity()` and `weightedDistance()` functions
- Updated: `analyzeInterest()` to use new algorithm
- Improved: User messages now show confidence scores and alternatives

### Testing
To test the algorithm, check console output which shows:
- Top 3 matches with similarity scores
- User responses array
- Category mappings being compared

This makes debugging and validation much easier!
