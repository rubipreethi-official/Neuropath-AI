## 📖 What is NeuroPath?

**NeuroPath** is an intelligent, context-aware career guidance web application designed to bridge the gap between passion, skill, and opportunity. We understand that every student's journey is unique—some know what they love but lack the skills, others have the talent but don't know where to apply it, and many struggle with finding the right institutions or financial support.

NeuroPath is here to change that.

## 🎯 The Problem We're Solving

### The Four Core Challenges Students Face:

#### 1. **The Passion Gap** 🔍
Some students are passionate about a field but lack the necessary skills to pursue it effectively. They need guidance on where to learn and how to grow.

#### 2. **The Awareness Gap** 💡
Many talented students don't know what courses or career paths align with their skills. They have the ability but lack direction.

#### 3. **The Institution Dilemma** 🏫
Finding the right college or training institution that matches your goals, location, and budget can be overwhelming and time-consuming.

#### 4. **The Financial Barrier** 💰
Brilliant minds shouldn't be held back by financial constraints. Many students are unaware of the scholarships and reservations available to them.
